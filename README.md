# Fuzzy2D-Game-Engine
A C++ 2D Game Engine built off of the SDL framework

Hello!

My name is Ramy Fawaz and I develop Video Games in my free time. 

The Fuzzy2D Engine is a passion project I've been working on throughout 2021. It's built off of the SDL Development Libraries (https://www.libsdl.org/). The code is entirely my own. 

For an example of the Engine in action, Check out: https://www.libsdl.org/
